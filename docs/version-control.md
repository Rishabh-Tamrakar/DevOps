# Version Control Basics

Version control systems (VCS) are essential tools in the DevOps lifecycle, allowing teams to manage changes to source code over time. This document will cover the basics of version control, focusing primarily on Git, one of the most widely used VCS.

## What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that records changes to files or sets of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It helps in tracking changes, reverting to previous states, and collaborating with others.

## Why Use Version Control?

- **Collaboration**: Multiple team members can work on the same project without conflicts.
- **History**: Keep a detailed history of changes made to the codebase.
- **Backup**: Protect against data loss by storing code in a remote repository.
- **Branching**: Experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.

## Introduction to Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. It tracks changes in the source code and enables collaboration.

### Basic Git Commands

1. **git init**: Initialize a new Git repository.
2. **git clone [url]**: Clone an existing repository from a remote source.
3. **git add [file]**: Stage changes for the next commit.
4. **git commit -m "[message]"**: Commit staged changes with a descriptive message.
5. **git push**: Upload local commits to a remote repository.
6. **git pull**: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository to your local branch.
7. **git branch**: List, create, or delete branches.
8. **git checkout [branch]**: Switch to a different branch.

### Git Workflows

- **Centralized Workflow**: A single central repository where all changes are pushed.
- **Feature Branch Workflow**: Each new feature is developed in its own branch, which is merged back into the main branch once complete.
- **Git Flow**: A branching model that defines a strict branching strategy for managing releases and features.

## Conclusion

Understanding version control is crucial for any DevOps team. Mastering Git and its workflows will enhance collaboration and streamline the development process.
