# Operating System Basics

## Introduction to Operating Systems
An operating system (OS) is a software that acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and the user. It manages hardware resources and provides services for computer programs.

## Types of Operating Systems
1. **Batch Operating Systems**: Execute jobs in batches without user interaction.
2. **Time-Sharing Operating Systems**: Allow multiple users to interact with the computer simultaneously.
3. **Distributed Operating Systems**: Manage a group of independent computers and make them appear to users as a single coherent system.
4. **Embedded Operating Systems**: Designed for specific control applications, often found in devices like washing machines and microwaves.

## Key Components of Operating Systems
- **Kernel**: The core part of the OS that manages system resources and communication between hardware and software.
- **User Interface**: The means by which users interact with the computer, which can be command-line or graphical.
- **File Management**: The way the OS organizes and keeps track of files on storage devices.
- **Process Management**: The handling of processes in the system, including scheduling and execution.
- **Memory Management**: The management of the computer's memory, including allocation and deallocation of memory spaces.

## Conclusion
Understanding the basics of operating systems is crucial for anyone looking to delve into fields like DevOps, as it lays the foundation for managing applications and services effectively.
