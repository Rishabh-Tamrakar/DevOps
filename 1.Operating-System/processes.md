# Processes in Operating Systems

## Introduction to Processes
A process is a program in execution, which includes the program code and its current activity. It is an essential concept in operating systems, as it allows multiple programs to run concurrently.

## Process States
Processes can exist in several states during their lifecycle:
- **New**: The process is being created.
- **Ready**: The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
- **Running**: Instructions are being executed.
- **Waiting**: The process is waiting for some event to occur (like I/O completion).
- **Terminated**: The process has finished execution.

## Process Scheduling
Operating systems use scheduling algorithms to determine which process runs at any given time. Common scheduling algorithms include:
- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job Next (SJN)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Priority Scheduling**

## Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
Processes often need to communicate with each other. IPC mechanisms include:
- **Pipes**: Allow data to flow in one direction between processes.
- **Message Queues**: Allow processes to send and receive messages.
- **Shared Memory**: Allows multiple processes to access the same memory space.

## Conclusion
Understanding processes is crucial for grasping how operating systems manage resources and execute programs efficiently. This knowledge lays the foundation for further exploration into system performance and optimization.
